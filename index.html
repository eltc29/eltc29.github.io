            Hi! my name is <span class='highlight'>Emile</span> and I am currently a second-year student
            at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science with a focus on software engineering.
            So far, my journey at UofT has allowed me to acquire so many skills both interpersonal and technical. With all the courses I have taken, I improved immensely on my time management
            skills and gained a lot of experience in various programming langugaes such as Java, Python
            and C. I learned about the most fundamental programming concepts and various software design patterns that were to be used depending on the
            specifications of a final product. Right now, i am mainly interested in web development and i have already created many small websites using different tools such as
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular and the MEAN Stack. In terms of my hobbies outside of school, I play the guitar,
            watch tv shows and play tennis. Career-wise, I am thinking of becoming a software engineer/developer and work at a company whose technology is very innovative and has a positive impact on the world.

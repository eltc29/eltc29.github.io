            Hi! my name is <span class='highlight'>Emile</span> and I am currently a second-year student
            at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science with a focus on software engineering.
            So far, my journey at UofT has allowed me to acquire and improve upon many of my interpersonal and technical skills. With all the courses I have taken, I improved immensely on my time management
            skills and gained a lot of experience in various programming langugaes such as Java, Python, C and JavaScript. I learned about the most fundamental programming concepts and various software design patterns that were to be used depending on the
            specifications of a final product. Right now, i am mainly interested in web development and i have already gained an extensive experience by working on both personal projects and school assignments (working in teams), using various development tools such as
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular and the MEAN Stack. In terms of my hobbies outside of school, I play the guitar,
            watch tv shows and play tennis. Career-wise, I am thinking of becoming a software engineer/developer and work at a company whose technology is very innovative and has a positive impact on the world.

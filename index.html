    <p id='para-wrap'>
    Hey! I'm Emile and I am currently a second-year student at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science with a focus on software engineering.<br><br>
    So far, my journey at UofT has allowed me to acquire so many skills from interpersonal to the technical. With all the courses I have taken, I improved immensely on my time management skills and gained a lot of experience in various programming langugaes such as Java, Python and C. I learned about the most fundamental programming concepts and various software design patterns that were to be used depending on the specifications of a final product. I also got interested in network programming when I learned about how to create connections between a server and a client using sockets. Right now, my interest lies in web development. Being already fluent in HTML, CSS and Javascipt, I am currently learning new web development tools such as the MEAN stack as I know that this is what the modern tech industry is using nowadays.<br><br>
    In terms of my hobbies outside of school, I play the guitar, watch anime tv shows and play tennis. Career-wise, I am thinking of becoming a software engineer or developer and work at a company whose technology is changing the world and really motivates and inspires me to work towards more innovative ideas when building new software.
